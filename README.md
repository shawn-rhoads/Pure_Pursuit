# VEX Tipping Point Pure Pursuit Library

Author: Shawn Rhoads
Uses AutoLib and Okabi libraries

This code implements VEX Robotics code with a Pure Pursuit movement sytem

I fixed AutoLib to be functional with the current version of Okapi and implemented a functioning Pure Pursuit algorithm. This allows the robot to drive in curves with precise movement during the VEX autonomous period.
