VEX Tipping Point Robotics Code

Author: Shawn Rhoads
This code implements VEX Robotics code with a Pure Pursuit movement sytem

I fixed AutoLib to be functional with the current version of Okapi and implemented a functioning Pure Pursuit algorithm. This allows the robot to drive in curves with precise movement during the VEX autonomous period.
