# VEX Tipping Point Pure Pursuit Library

Author: Shawn Rhoads

Uses AutoLib and Okabi libraries

This code implements a Pure Pursuit movement sytem to be used with mentioned libraries



Note: I fixed AutoLib to be functional with the current version of Okapi. To use the Pure Pursuit algorithm it is important to incorporate the changes to Okapi.
