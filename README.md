# VEX Tipping Point Pure Pursuit Library

Author: Shawn Rhoads

Uses AutoLib and Okabi libraries

This code implements a Pure Pursuit movement sytem to be used with mentioned libraries

I fixed AutoLib to be functional with the current version of Okapi and implemented a functioning Pure Pursuit algorithm. This allows the robot to drive in curves with precise movement during the VEX autonomous period.
