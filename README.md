# VEX Tipping Point Pure Pursuit Library

IMPORTANT: ORIGINAL LIBRARY BY 
@author D Michael Jones, 914M - acetousk
@author Ryan Benasutti, WPI - Octogonapus

I fixed issues within the library and implemented my own version of the Pure Pursuit algorithm.


Note: I fixed AutoLib to be functional with the current version of Okapi. To use the Pure Pursuit algorithm it is important to incorporate the changes to Okapi.
